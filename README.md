Prambanan Enigma, mystical beauty in the Three.js project. This three-dimensional website project displays a model of Prambanan Temple bathed in bright white light. Inspired by a local myth that tells of a mysterious light that appears on Goddess Durga's face every full moon night. The statue of Goddess Durga is located in one of the rooms in the main temple, namely the Shiva Temple. Local people believe this is a manifestation of Roro Jonggrang's aura.

It is said that people who have not yet found a partner compete to get this light because people believe that it will speed up meeting their soul mate. Apart from that, this project also presents a green light surrounding the Prambanan Temple model, this is inspired by another myth about the existence of a guardian genie who protects Prambanan Temple.

According to the story, these genies maintain the security and secrecy of the temple and give blessings to those who come with good intentions. Prambanan Enigma is a project inspired by where I live, Prambanan. The place where I spent my childhood with friends. Memories of playing, such as walking in the morning after dawn during the month of Ramadan and bathing in a small river called Kali Londo which is close to Prambanan Temple, are very meaningful to me.
